# python_test01

This repository demonstrates a simple Python module import example.

The custom module is located in `MyModule/` and provides a `say_hello` function.
A sample application under `app/testapp/` imports this module and prints a greeting.

Run the sample application with:

```bash
python app/testapp/sample.py
```
